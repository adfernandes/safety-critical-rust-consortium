## **Agenda**

1. Solicitation of notetaker  
2. Acceptance of [Previous Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/Safety-Critical-Rust-Consortium/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/meetings/2026-06-17/minutes.md)  
3. Introduction of new members  
4. Solicit availability for RustConf 2026 SCRC Room (Pete)  
- Please put availability on this [LettuceMeet](https://lettucemeet.com/l/oYlvM)  
5. The SCRC as a member organization of the Rust Commercial Network (RCN)  
- [RFC PR](https://github.com/Safety-Critical-Rust-Consortium/safety-critical-rust-consortium-rfcs/pull/8)  
- RCN announcement goes out today with the SCRC as a founding member organization  
6. Draft document for usage of standards documents  
- Current draft: [Usage Terms of Standards Documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctOOMA81slp8N4Sja_FmeDLaneEmtyIplL9EtYilM3s/edit?usp=sharing)  
- Located in the publicly accessible folder on the SCRC Google Drive: [Standards Documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fgcca7tbpc0iLoZf1AQR_v9Kh51rungp?usp=drive_link)  
- How do we feel about these? Suggestions?  
7. Discuss possible 2-3 coding guidelines to choose for Clippy lints (Pete)  
- How've we done in looking into these?	  
8. First version of MISRA C \+ CERT C Appendices [live](https://coding-guidelines.arewesafetycriticalyet.org/appendices/standards-matrices/index.html)  
- Pete *must still* mine these appendices for creating issues for contributors  
9. Safety-Critical Rust: Items of Shared Value for Fund Pooling (Pete)  
- One of the action items Pete took from the SCRC Room at RustWeek 2026  
- Things seem to be heating up with the formation of the Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund (RFMF) and Ecosystem Fund and the Funding Team. Would be good to make sure we make our needs and requests obvious and clear.  
- Pete will screen share and show the draft and then share it afterwards for feedback  
- Would we like to form up a working group temporarily to get this in good shape?  
- A first (0th?) draft document is available here: [Safety-Critical Rust - Items of Shared Value for Fund Pooling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E39cNTjK-5azCeWWFWS1jORsz9nqzMs4CNa6Rm68jV4/edit?usp=sharing)  
10. Interest in the MISRA C++ mapping (mira / Pete)  
- Updates on new things in the MISRA C++ \=\> Rust mapping  
- In talks with MISRA folks still; but in practice the procedure outlined seemed reasonable to them  
- Please register interest on [this Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/579369-safety-critical-consortium.2Fcoding-guidelines/topic/MISRA.20C.2B.2B.20Mapping.20Interest/with/584764785)  
11. Review batches for [CERT C  Rust Mapping](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/336) (Pete)  
- Let's split up again, to get some feedback on batch 2

Overview of [Safety-Critical Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2026/roadmap-safety-critical-rust.html)  Rust Project Goals Roadmap (Pete)

- Soliciting those interested in [Normative Documentation for Sound unsafe Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2026/safe-unsafe-for-safety-critical.html) goal  
  - Register interest [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium/topic/SCRC.20.3C.3D.3E.20t-opsem.3A.20Normative.20Documentation.20for.20Sound.20.60unsafe.60/with/586198564) on Rust Zulip  
- Soliciting those interested in [Establish a Spot for Safety-Critical Lints in Clippy](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2026/safety-critical-lints-in-clippy.html) goal  
  - Register interest [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium/topic/Getting.20involved.20with.20Clippy.20for.20SCRC.20lints/with/583090116) on Rust Zulip  
- SCRC as a member organization of the Rust Commercial Network (RCN)  
  - Asked to give feedback at [https://github.com/Safety-Critical-Rust-Consortium/safety-critical-rust-consortium-rfcs/pull/8](https://github.com/Safety-Critical-Rust-Consortium/safety-critical-rust-consortium-rfcs/pull/8)  
  - No change in government in SCRC. Code Conduct, Bylaws …. will not change.  
- Draft document for usage of standards documents  
  - Draft available with rules about standard use.  
  - Requested review  
  - Standards will be not publicly available. Access shall be granted and they can be read but not downloaded.  
- First version of MISRA C \+ CERT C   
  - Appendixes are live.  
  - Provided to Toyota for internal use.  
- Interest in the MISRA C++ mapping  
  - Question if FFI guidelines shall be considered or not.  
    1. Proposed to handle as any other Misra C++ rules.  
    2. Some doubts about preprocessor and FFI rule. E..g    
  - rule 19.0.3. There are 2 rationale, the most safety relevant is the one about including code as copy and paste. Including in weird places change the semantic. This should be advisory for Rust.   
  - Rust has a macro for textual include that is rarely used and if case we should have a guidelines “include\!”.  
  - Rule 16.1 Apply to Rust  
    1.    
  - Rule 13.1.1 Inheritance  
    1. The issue boils down to diamond inheritance but it seems not applicable to Rust.  
  - Rule 10.1.2 about volatile  
    1. Maybe it needs more thinking.  
  - Rule 21.2.3   
    1. Applicable to Rust  
  - Rule 28.6.1  
    1. Applicable to Rust because the C++ rule is about a move that can be converted to a copy  
- Safety-Critical Rust: Items of Shared Value for Fund Pooling  
  - Presented document to describe what is worth to be funded  
  - [Open for feedback:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E39cNTjK-5azCeWWFWS1jORsz9nqzMs4CNa6Rm68jV4/edit?usp=sharing)
