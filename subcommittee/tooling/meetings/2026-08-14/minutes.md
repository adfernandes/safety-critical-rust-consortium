      2. [One PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/fls/pull/717) that maybe should go in, fixing up imports, before we review and then merge [1.97 content](https://github.com/rust-lang/fls/pull/713) and then release  
   2. [Normative Documentation for Sound `unsafe` Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/goals/2026/safe-unsafe-for-safety-critical.html)  
      1. Eclipse iceoryx2 maintainers have updated [https://github.com/ekxide/iox2-scrc-examples](https://github.com/ekxide/iox2-scrc-examples) with [stories](https://github.com/ekxide/iox2-scrc-examples/blob/main/Stories.md) that can be told about their usage of unsafe, in-line with a suggestion by RalfJ  
      2. Andreas Weiss will ask in the t-opsem Zulip stream about the bit they have about Safety, which is mostly either (1) non-controversial or (2) calling into platform primitives  
      3. We will aim for a follow-up meeting with RalfJ
